# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-
This project predicts the quality of wine (Good, Average, or Bad) based on its physicochemical properties using  machine learning algorithms. The model is trained and evaluated on Wine Quality dataset, and achieves high accuracy through ensemble techniques and proper feature engineering.
